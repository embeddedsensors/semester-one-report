\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Phase one (Fall 2014)}

The objective of the first phase of this project was to explore a practice for exciting a scale steel rod with an acoustic signal. A methodology for determining the best frequencies of propagation was developed in order to be applied to large scale system. This was to involve the testing of theoretical calculations to determine whether or not resonant frequencies could be accurately predicted using the method. Experiments were to be carried out on a small scale steel rod for several types of excitations. The results of which were to be compared to the expected theoretical calculation to verify the accuracy of the prediction method. Resonant frequencies were selected to be the best frequencies of propagation due to the fact that they cary the best in a medium. Injection of a signal at the resonant frequency of a medium would require less amplitude than other spectra and might result in a stronger response of returned signal.
